This is a second year Database course project. In this project we implement a bird watching/recording website with Postgre as backend database. We use GraphQL api to communicate with server.

    Use PGAdmin and add a new database e190xxxx_birds (use VPN)
    Create table observation with field bird (short name), datetime, location, user email 
    Create a new microservice running in port 5001 as graphql
    (optional) protect the server keep just ports 22, 5000, 5001 open
    (Optional) Add password protection using JWT
    (optional) Create a frond end to add new observations to observation table
    Return the URL for the repository and (optional) client
